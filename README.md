Blink SV
===========

What is Blink SV?
-------------------

[Blink SV (Satoshi Vision)](https://blinksv.io/) is the original Blink.  It restores the original Blink 
protocol, will keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.  Blink SV will maintain the vision set out by Satoshi 
Nakamotoâ€™s white paper in 2008.  This Github repository provides open-source software to enable use of Blink SV.
